# Mother 3 Sprite Game

Project for college.

To use it, download the repo, make sure you have Java installed, and double-click mother3sprites_runnable.jar

Clicking on a character changes the sprite and position, different characters move more. 

I had planned for the sprites to be animated when clicked on but I couldn't figure out how to do it in time.
