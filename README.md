# Mother 3 Sprite Game

Project for college.

To use it, you need a Java IDE like Eclipse, and then you run Field.java.

Clicking on a character changes the sprite and position, different characters move more. 

I had planned for the sprites to be animated when clicked on but I couldn't figure out how to do it in time.
